# Example configuration for devws CLI

# This file defines the components and their configurations for your development workstation setup.
# You can enable or disable specific components and customize their settings.

      # - "my_project_config.json"
      # - "secrets/*.txt"

# Configuration for syncing files/directories from the user's home directory (~) to GCS.
# These items will be backed up/restored to the GCS `user-home/` path, maintaining their
# relative structure from the home directory.
#
# Each item in the list should have:
#   - path (required): The path to the file or directory relative to the user's home directory (~).
#                      e.g., ".bashrc", ".ssh/config", ".config/some_app/"
#   - type (required): "file" or "directory". Specifies how to handle the item.
#
# Example:
# user_home_sync:
#   - path: ".bashrc"
#     type: "file"
#   - path: ".ssh/config"
#     type: "file"
#   - path: ".config/devws/config.yaml"
#     type: "file" # Note: devws-config.yaml itself is handled explicitly by user-config backup/restore
#   - path: ".gemini"
#     type: "directory"

# Custom components that run after all core components.
# These components are executed in the order they are defined.
#
# Each component can have the following properties:
#   - id (required): A unique identifier for the component. This ID will be used as the filename for the corresponding
#     shell script in the GCS `user-components/` folder (e.g., `install-my-tool.sh` if `id` is `install-my-tool`).
#   - name (required): A human-readable name for the component.
#   - description (required): A brief explanation of what the component does.
#   - enabled (optional): Set to `false` to disable the component. Default is `true`.
#   - idempotent_check (optional): A shell command that returns exit code 0 if the component
#     is already completed/verified, and non-zero otherwise. If not provided, the component
#     will always be executed unless explicitly disabled.
#   - on_failure (optional): Defines behavior if the component's script fails.
#     Options: "abort" (stop execution), "continue" (proceed to next component).
#     Default is "continue".
#   - tier (optional): Categorizes the component for execution priority.
#     Options: 1 (core), 2 (common tools), 3 (custom). Default is 3.
#
# Example:
# custom_components:
#   - id: "install-my-tool"
#     name: "Install My Custom Tool"
#     description: "Installs a custom command-line tool via a shell script."
#     enabled: true
#     idempotent_check: "command -v my-tool"
#     on_failure: "abort"
#     tier: 3
#   - id: "setup-dev-env"
#     name: "Set Up Dev Environment"
#     description: "Runs a custom script to configure environment variables and aliases."
#     enabled: true
#     idempotent_check: "grep -q 'MY_CUSTOM_VAR' ~/.bashrc"
#     on_failure: "continue"
#     tier: 3
