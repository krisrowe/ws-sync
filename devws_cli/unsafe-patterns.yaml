# Default generic regex patterns for `devws safecheck`.
# These patterns are designed to detect common sensitive information.
#
# IMPORTANT: These patterns use regex to avoid containing the literal sensitive string
# they are designed to detect. This minimizes the risk of the pattern's own definition
# triggering a false positive when this file itself is scanned.
#
# Users can optionally set up an override for this file in their own config,
# but by default, these patterns are always applied as part of the tool's core checks.
